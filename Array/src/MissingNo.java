/*Given an array arr[] of size N-1 with integers in the range of [1, N], the task is to find the missing number from the first N integers.

Note: There are no duplicates in the list.

Input: arr[] = {1, 2, 4, 6, 3, 7, 8}, N = 8
Output: 5
Explanation: The missing number between 1 to 8 is 5*/

Calculate the sum of the first N natural numbers as sumtotal= N*(N+1)/2.
Traverse the array from start to end.
Find the sum of all the array elements.
Print the missing number as SumTotal â€“ sum of array*/
